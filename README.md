# 05 work-day-planner


## My Task

This week's Challenge was to modify starter code to create an application that allows a user to save tasks for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JQuery. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.
